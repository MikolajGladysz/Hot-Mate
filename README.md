# Hot Mate

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.9.

Hot Mate  is a dating app specifically designed for chess players. It allows users to connect with other players and find dates. 


Using the app, users can't view other players' profiles yet, only bots account. 

The app is currently in development and Im working hard to add more features. In the future, I plan to add a backend to store user data and a notification system to let users know when someone has messaged them.

I hope that this app will help bring the chess community together and make it easier for players to find dates and connect. 

If you have any suggestions or feedback, we would love to hear from you!


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
